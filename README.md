# GRPC Browser

Needs to be done

- [ ] GRPC channel reconnection
- [X] Send result back to Websocket
- [X] Support different operations at the same time
- [ ] Add default metadata (grpc-browser = true for example)
- [ ] Support passing additional metadata


Nice to have:

- [ ] Streaming support
- [ ] Support protobufjs/minimal. Right now it only supports @bufbuild/protobuf
